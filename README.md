# Singleton Design Pattern Example

This project is a demonstration of the Singleton design pattern using Unity. The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main scripts:

1. **GameManager**: Implements the Singleton pattern to manage game state and logic.
2. **Enemy**: Represents an enemy in the game that interacts with the GameManager.
